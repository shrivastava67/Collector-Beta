## Introduction

Welcome to the Log Aggregator Desktop Application project! This application is designed to simplify the process of collecting logs from multiple operating systems (OS), both with and without an agent, as well as file systems, and then sending them to a central server via an API. 

Managing logs from various sources in a centralized manner is crucial for monitoring, troubleshooting, and analyzing system behavior.

## Features

- **Multi-OS Support:** Collect logs from a variety of operating systems including Windows, macOS, and various Linux distributions.
- **Agentless Log Collection:** Collect logs without the need to install agents on target systems.
- **File System Logs:** In addition to OS logs, collect logs from file systems to track changes and access.
- **API Integration:** Send collected logs to a central server through a RESTful API.
- **Configurable:** Easily configure the application to specify which logs to collect and where to send them.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** An intuitive desktop application interface for configuration and monitoring.
